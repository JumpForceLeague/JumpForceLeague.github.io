	    	<h3>Important League Announcement! - 05/12/2020</h3>
		<p class="news" > Hello ladies and Mecha Naruto Fans! <br>

		We have a last minute update to the stream on Friday.
		Instead of jumping right into the main season we have decided to go forward with a short 2 week preseason in order to give teams a spotlight for new supporters looking to join and also less of a blind spot going into week 1. 
		To further avoid issues week one of the preseason will be the same matches as week 1 of the main season (subject to change in later seasons) and the second week will be the same as week 7 of the main season. 
		We apologize for the extremely late change and hopefully will not have this happen again. 
		Builds submitted will be kept on the basis that the matchup has not changed and we apologize for any grief or concern we caused with this. 			For everyone else builds are due at 11:59pm est Wednesday. Lastly the bets in place for week 1 will be refunded and will be open again after the preseason.
		<br>
		Thank you for reading this and being patient with us as we are using this first season to learn and grow to bring you guys an even better JFL experience.
		<br> <br>Remember DURAW MONSTA CARDO!</p>
